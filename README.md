# Weapon_recognition_model_and_telebot
The project is designed to determine the presence of weapons on the streaming image. 
If people with weapons appear in the frame, then the users of the telegram bot receive an appropriate notification.

The files "keras_model.h5" and "labels" were uploaded after training on the Teachable Machine website. 
If necessary, the model can be retrained and the files in the repository can be changed.
